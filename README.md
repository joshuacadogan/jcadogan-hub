Hi I'm Joshua Cadogan. Currently I am a 4th year Physics student in Canada with interests in computational methods in dealing with difficult numerical problems.

My aim is to use GitHub primarily as a source to keep track of changes to projects as well as a description of previous attempts to solve them!
